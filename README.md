Module Title: Programming for Geographical Information Analysis (Core skills)

Module Code: GEOG5990

Introduction: 

This practical allows the use of a Graphic User Interface (Gui) to
create an Agent Based Model (ABM) by importing some data from the website. This gives way for moving, eating, sharing the agents to have interaction with the environment. 
This models allows easy plotting of agents on the environment, calculate the distance between agents and get the agents animated as well.

The working files which make up this model:
Below are the files I used in building an Agent Based Model using a Graphic User Interface;

First and foremost, the import operator was used to import all files and functions to create an agent based model.

Secondly, the csv file was imported. The csv file helps the agents to be exchanged and listed.

Furthermore, the Gui.py file was imported. The Gui.py is the final model which is meant to open a model and also run it in an opened window. tkinter window is used as a method because it offers the easiest way of establishing a Graphical User Interface.

Also, commframework.py file was imported as agentframework.py file. This helps to establish agents in the environment. I used commframework as agentframework because I started using commframework when doing the practical session called communication where the agents are talking to each other in the environment. In short, I just like using commframework as agentframework when writing my codes.

Moreover, in.txt file was used: This file helps in reading the code.

Again, matplotlib.pyplot was imported to allow plotting of agents on the environment. The matplotlib.animation was also imported to make sure that the model is being animated. 

The tkinter was also imported in order to create a tkinter window for the model to be easily run. 

How the Graphical User Interface model can be run:

Below are the steps involved in running the Graphical User Interface model:

1. The Graphical User Interface model can be run by clicking on the run file or pressing the F5 button in the anaconda spyder (version 3.7) python software.

2. A pop up window will be displayed so you will click on the model  and run it. Always make sure that inline is set before you run the model.

  What happens after running the model
 
 After running the code, you will see the agents moving, eating the grasses and interracting with environment. 
 The moving agents will be displayed in a graph through the spyder Ipython console. The distance covered between the agents will be displayed in the spyder Ipython console.
